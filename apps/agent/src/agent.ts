                  the fact these two activities are for a challenge so we need to
                  ensure that they were properly recorded with the images as proof
                  and that all the data presented records a steady and senseful
                  progression of the runner in whatever activity they were doing.

                  Use the smallest distance of the activities presented to you and
                  use that as the base to determine who could win the challenge. For example,
                  if you get one for 2km and one for 5km, try to determine what would have
                  been the data of the 5km one at if it had run for 2km as well to ensure
                  a fair and balanced outcome. An activity is considered invalid if there
                  is not sign of heart rate being recorded.

                  250 characters. "activityId" is the ID of the activity that was
                  analyzed based on the input you received.

                  "winnerActivityId" is the winner of the challenge according to the analysis
                  you just performed. Similar to "activityId" this is the ID of the
                  activity that was analyzed based on the input you received.

                  "analysisOutcome" is a brief summary of the outcome of the analysis
                  you just performed. Why do you think the winner was the one that
                  was chosen? Keep this to max 500 characters.
